Situated in an area prone to climate-related challenges due to its low elevation, the association faced adversity from floods, strong winds, and typhoons. Despite these obstacles, their determination to succeed drove them to seek support from the Department of Agriculture's Adaptation and Mitigation Initiatives in Agriculture (DA-AMIA) project.​</p>

                    <p class="mb-0 abc">In 2021, their efforts were celebrated as they achieved recognition as the third Amia Village in Agusan del Sur province. This marked a turning point, bringing essential agricultural inputs and machinery to bolster their rice, vegetable, duck, chicken, and tilapia production. Through interventions like the egg machine, floating tiller, and pump and engine set, provided by DA-AMIA, the association not only enhanced their farming capabilities but also fortified their resilience against environmental challenges.​</p>

                    <p class="mb-0 abc">To develop food sustainability and earn more, the association was taught to practice a diversified farming system for its 2-hectare farm. They practice crop rotation for vegetables, and intercropping for upland areas, strategies that not only enhance productivity but also contribute to sustainable farming practices.​</p>
